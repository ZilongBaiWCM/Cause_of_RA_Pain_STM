# -------
# Main steps
# 1) We first selected the highly variable genes from both sides that we 
#    can keep the data set specific variation; 
# 2) Based on the shared highly variable genes, we integrate single-cell RNA-seq 
#    with bulk RNA-seq by CCA (Gonz√°lez et al. 2008); 
# 3) We calculate the cell-to-cell similarity matrix on top 10 CCA canonical 
#    dimensions based on Euclidean distance;
# 4) We build up a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph based on the cell-to-cell similarity matrix; 
#    We then convert the KNN neighbor relation matrix into an adjacency matrix; 
# 5) We cluster the cells using Infomap algorithm (cluster_infomap function from igraph package) 
#    for community detection to decompose the cell-to-cell adjacency matrix into major modules; 
# 6) We then construct a low dimensional embedding using tSNE based on 
#    the cell-to-cell distance matrix with cell clusters labeled; 
# 7) We identify and prioritize significantly differential expressed (DE) genes for 
#    each distinct cluster using AUC and Wilcox test; 
# 8) For pathway analysis, we downloaded gene sets from Gene Ontology (GO) terms on April 2016. 
#    We also use the immunologic signatures from 4,872 hallmark gene sets from MSigDB (Liberzon et al. 2015)
#    to test enrichment of all the tested DE genes sorted by decreased AUC scores 
#    for each cluster using liger.
#
# NOTE: 
# 1) coarse clustering and fine clustering follow the same pipeline
#    For fine clustering, please run the piepeline on cells from one cell type 
# 2) Since graph-based clustering is based on random walk (a stochastic process), the results depand on nk (KNN step), 
#    and also the number dimensions ncc (CCA step), and the number of selected features as well.
